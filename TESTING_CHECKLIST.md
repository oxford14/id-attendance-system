# ID Attendance System - Testing Checklist

## Prerequisites Check
- [ ] Node.js (v16 or higher) installed
- [ ] npm package manager available
- [ ] Supabase account created
- [ ] Environment variables configured in `.env` file

## Installation Steps
1. [ ] Run `npm install` to install dependencies
2. [ ] Configure `.env` file with Supabase credentials
3. [ ] Set up Supabase database using `database/schema.sql`
4. [ ] Run `npm run dev` to start development server

## Authentication Testing
- [ ] User registration works correctly
- [ ] User login functionality
- [ ] User logout functionality
- [ ] Protected routes redirect to login when not authenticated
- [ ] Public routes accessible without authentication
- [ ] AuthContext properly manages user state

## Student Management Testing
- [ ] Add new student with all required fields
- [ ] Edit existing student information
- [ ] Delete student records
- [ ] View student list with proper formatting
- [ ] Search/filter students functionality
- [ ] RF ID validation (unique constraint)

## RFID Scanning Testing
- [ ] Scan valid RF ID marks attendance
- [ ] Invalid RF ID shows appropriate error
- [ ] Duplicate scan prevention (same day)
- [ ] Recent scans display correctly
- [ ] Student information shows after successful scan
- [ ] Attendance record created in database

## Database Integration
- [ ] Supabase connection established
- [ ] Students table operations (CRUD)
- [ ] Attendance table operations
- [ ] Parents table integration
- [ ] Row Level Security (RLS) policies active
- [ ] Database triggers functioning

## UI/UX Testing
- [ ] Responsive design on different screen sizes
- [ ] Navigation between components
- [ ] Form validation and error messages
- [ ] Loading states during operations
- [ ] Success/error notifications
- [ ] Consistent styling across components

## Security Testing
- [ ] Environment variables not exposed in client
- [ ] Supabase RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
- [ ] Input validation on all forms
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] XSS protection

## Performance Testing
- [ ] Fast loading times
- [ ] Efficient database queries
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Memory usage optimization

## Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Chrome/Chromium
- [ ] Firefox
- [ ] Safari
- [ ] Edge

## Known Issues to Address
1. **Node.js Not Installed**: The development environment needs Node.js and npm to run
2. **Environment Setup**: `.env` file needs to be configured with actual Supabase credentials
3. **Database Setup**: Supabase database schema needs to be executed

## Next Steps for Testing
1. Install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/
2. Run `npm install` in the project directory
3. Configure Supabase project and update `.env` file
4. Execute database schema in Supabase dashboard
5. Start development server with `npm run dev`
6. Test all functionality systematically
